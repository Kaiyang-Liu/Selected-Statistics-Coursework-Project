# Selected-Statistics-Coursework-Project
This repo contains some selected coursework Group projects in UIC undergraduate statistics course

# 1. Regression Analysis: Nonlinear Regression - The Gauss-Newton Estimation
This project mainly focus on introducing the algorithm of Gauss-Newton Estimation and R code implementation. The motivation, properties of estimation, an example, and further discussion of the algorithm are also included.

# 2. Optimization: The Strategy to Implement an Optimize Pipes Purchasing and Shipping Plan (2000 CUMCM-Problem B)
This project includes a academic thesis that constructing a mutiple nonlinear optimization model and gave the solution of optimal total cost of purchasing and shipping plan. The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm was included to solve the model and implemented by MATLAB.

# 3. Simulation: Inventory Problem Model
This project mainly focus on introducing a inventory model among store, depot, and inventory by using MATLAB. Also, the simulation result for a one-month trace of the inventory model are included. (Eg. Customers demands, profit of store, remaining amount of product at depot and inventory, and their corresponding time ) 

# 4. Data Mining: Prediction of the result of Pokémon one-on-one combat
This project mainly focus on the prediction of the result of Pokémon one-on-one combat by using 8 different classification methods according to different character of Pokémon. (Logistic Regression, Neural Network, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, LDA, Naive Bayesian and Bayesian Network; Implemented using R)
